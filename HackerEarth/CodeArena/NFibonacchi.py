Harold always boasted about his prowess with numbers. So one day Reese challenged him to a problem. 
He gave Harold two numbers X and Y and asked him to find out the Nth number of the series which began with X numbers 
of Yâ€™s and the following elements are equal to the sum of the last X numbers in the series. 
Help Harold find the Nth number of the series.

Input:
The first line contains a number T , number of test cases.
The next T lines each contain 3 integers X, Y and N separated by single space.

Output: 
For each test case print the Nth number of the sequence.

SAMPLE INPUT 
1
3 2 7
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
-
34
Explanation
For X=3,Y=2 the series will be as follow:
2, 2, 2, 6, 10, 18, 34
